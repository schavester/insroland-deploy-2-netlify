<p>A young couple by the name of McCarthy came to Los Angeles in 1890, and quickly made money in the real estate game. As luck would have it, one year later, Mr. McCarthy fell ill and died.&nbsp; His widow, a healthy, handsome woman, was left a well appointed house on Temple street, but she proved unable to overcome her grief at the loss of her husband.&nbsp; She shut herself in her second story parlor, and refused her friends invitations and entreaties to re-enter society.&nbsp; Desperate to console her, they suggested she seek out spiritual support, and referred her to Mrs. Rich, a trance-medium of some local renown. After the widow had been visiting the medium for several weeks, friends noticed a definite change in her behavior.&nbsp; When they called on her in her rooms they found her greatly agitated, crouched down in one corner of her room, clutching paper and pencil, which she used, she explained, to record messages from her dead husband.&nbsp; The messages allegedly emanated from all corners and quarters of the room, and were sometimes delivered by a little girl named &#8220;Dewdrop.&#8221; </p>
<p>Mrs. McCarthy&#8217;s friends tried to calm her, and seemingly succeeded.&nbsp; But soon thereafter the widow disappeared from her house on Temple street. Ten days later a police officer apprehended a raving woman, unsteady on her feet, in a hallway&nbsp; near the corner of Sixth and Main streets. Her face was covered in red welts, and her tongue badly swollen. The officer suspected she was intoxicated, but soon discovered that she was bereft of reason. He was about to take the poor woman to the city prison, when a gentleman happened to recognize her as his neighbor, Mrs. McCarthy. He delivered her to her friends from Temple street, who took her into their home to convalesce.&nbsp; Gradually, she recovered her wits and told them her story.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Mrs. McCarthy had come to believe that if she strictly obeyed Mrs. Rich, the trance medium, in every regard, then she would, in time, be allowed to communicate with her dead husband.&nbsp; At the medium&#8217;s instruction, Mrs. McCarthy gave Mrs. Rich all but 300 dollars of her personal fortune. The medium then promptly fled the city with her haul.&nbsp; Distraught, Mrs. McCarthy sought out another clairvoyant, a Mrs. Coy, who plied her trade as a magnetic healer. Mrs. Coy, assisted by an unidentified man, took the half-demented widow into her house, drugged her, and shut her in a dark room for days.&nbsp; They persuaded the widow to write checks for all of her remaining funds, and to give up her fur-trimmed cloak and her fine dress, for only if she were to renounce all wordly possessions, they claimed, would &#8220;the spirit of her dead husband see fit to address her.&#8221; On her way home to change she was intercepted by the police officer. </p>
<p>Mrs. McCarthy was unable to recover her lost savings.&nbsp; Mrs. Coy claimed it was the widow&#8217;s idea to give up her money and her clothing, as she &#8220;wanted to do penance,&#8221; and that she merely assisted Mrs. McCarthy in her spiritual quest.</p>

<p>He triumphed over a gaggle of LAâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s most prominent legal minds, only to be undone by a second rate mentalist with a trumped-up Teutonic alias.&nbsp; Shortly after establishing a law practice in Los Angeles, young George D. Blake, Esq. landed one of the cityâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s most sensational divorce cases, Mayberry v. Mayberry.&nbsp; Mr. Mayberry, an original California pioneer and prominent landowner, possessed an estate valued at more than a million dollars.&nbsp; In 1899 his wife brought suit against him for divorce on grounds of extreme cruelty and adultery. George D. Blake represented Mrs. Mayberry in a bitter trial that lasted several weeks. Despite employing four separate law firms in his defense, amounting to a team of every well-heeled lawyer in town, Mr. Mayberry was found guilty of acts of atrocious cruelty towards his wife, who had become a paraplegic as a result of a beating her husband administered to her during one of his many violent rages. </p>
<p>But George Blakeâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s reign at the top of the LA legal establishment lasted only a few short years. After the tragic death of his wife, Blake sought out spiritualists who promised to put him in contact with his departed spouse. <br /><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2600/3830182351_6e9c4edf06.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p>In 1904 he became especially close with one medium, Maude Von Freitag, a slate-writer who often plied her mind-reading trade at regular sÃ©ances in Harmonial Hall at 125 West Fifth Street.&nbsp; During one of these events local authorities caught her sneaking peaks at folded slips of paper she alleged she could read without opening. </p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2515/3830977846_1dd8cb824b.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p>Attorney Blake, unperturbed by rumors of Von Freitagâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s fraud, or by ample evidence of her fondness for liquor and morphine, took up with her with a passion, truly a passion, and accompanied her on a series of out of town trips of many days duration.&nbsp; Von Freitagâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s husband and two children did not accompany them on these spiritual journeys. </p>
<p>In the fall of that year, Blake suffered a mental and physical breakdown, and spent weeks in the care of physicians at California Hospital.&nbsp; From there he went on to recuperate at a sanatorium near his motherâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s house in Pontiac, Illinois, where he reunited with a childhood love, May Babcock.&nbsp; When he returned to Los Angeles in January of 1905, Miss Babcock accompanied him.&nbsp; But Maude Von Freitag still doted on her fellow spiritual traveler, and when she fell ill in March, she contacted Blake.&nbsp; Within the week the dashing Miss Babcock had packed up and headed back to Pontiac, Illinois.&nbsp; </p>
<p>George Blake took on the cost of Von Freitagâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s care at a private hospital at no. 513 East Twelfth Street, and at Von Freitagâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s urging even went so far as to try to obtain a loan for $5,000 dollars, in order to take part in a grand scheme involving millions of dollars, a complicated arrangement meant to insure the lifelong financial support of Von Freitag and her family. But the loan didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t go through.&nbsp; At this point Von Freitag, likely sensing her influence over Blake might soon wane again, pulled out all the stops. In early April, she invited Blake to her sick-room, where she told him she would soon â€œpass-outâ€ of this life, and asked that he lie down next to her on her bed to have one last talk about her approaching death, the mortgage of certain properties, and the future of her two children.&nbsp; During this conversation, as Blake later described to a friend, Von Freitag spoke to him of â€œhigh forcesâ€ and â€œlords of Karmaâ€, she called herself Theodora, and explained to Blake that when she succumbed to death her soul would fly out of her body and into his, to be with him always, until he too passed out of the life, whereupon they would both sweep spiritward and dwell together on the astral plane. Von Freitag then fell into a fit of convulsions, and Blake let out a series of blood curdling screams that brought nurses and doctors to the door, only to find Blake in delirium, holding a limp Von Freitag in his arms.&nbsp; In the wake of subsequent events, shocked Angelenos surmised that Von Freitag placed Blake under a hypnotic spell of sorts during this visit, a spell that led directly to his ultimate loss of all hold on reality.</p>
<p>For three weeks after this episode, Blake managed to resume his law practice, but on April 24th, his frayed cord to reason snapped. While attending a performance at a Main Street theater he found himself possessed by a spirit and was compelled to lead the orchestra.&nbsp; The management didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t care for this, and sent for the police.&nbsp; Later in the evening Blake was thrown out of a cafÃ© for disturbing the peace.&nbsp; It seems the headwaiter was offended by Blakeâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s claim that he had assumed the genius and character of the late Emma Abbot, a famous opera singer of the past century.&nbsp; Blake spoke loudly to anyone who would listen about his plans to sue all parties involved in the fracas for 150 â€“ 500 thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Blake then spent several days calling reporters to tell them of a suit he was pursuing to recover an English estate worth 64 million dollars.&nbsp; (Ah, Nigerian email-type schemes have always been with us!)&nbsp; He raved to the police officer assigned to restrain him of his appointment as â€œMost High Masterâ€, working for the forces of good, in the name of which he and others like him would, tomorrow, at 9 oâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />clock, erect a bank at Third and Broadway, the most magnificent bank human eyes have ever conjured or human brain ever conceivedâ€¦&nbsp; capitalized at 2 billion dollars, offering interest at 4%.&nbsp; He, Blake would be president, and would make pawnshops of the other banks, usurers that they are, charging 10 percent!&nbsp; A crowd gathered on South Broadway as Blake was escorted from his offices in the courthouse to an Olive Street Hotel, to await arrest and commitment to Highland Asylum for the Insane. Blake was taken to Highland on May 10th. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Maude Von Freitag, her story continued after Blakeâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s sad exit from sanity.&nbsp; Mere weeks after she claimed she lay at deathâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s door, Von Freitag experienced a miraculous recovery at the hands of an occultist colleague (or â€œsensation-monger spookâ€ as the LA Timesâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> preferred to describe her). Von Freitag even returned to her lecturing career.&nbsp; The medium responsible for Von Freitagâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s complete restoration to health offered to try her technique on George Blake, but was turned away at the door of the asylum.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>George D. Blake, Esquire, never returned from Highland.&nbsp; He refused food and medical attention, and died there in November 1906, at the age of 43.&nbsp; </p>

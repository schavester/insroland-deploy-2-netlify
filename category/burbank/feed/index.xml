										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lili St. Cyr was a marquee burlesque striptease star known for her bubble bath routine. Tempest Storm who went onstage just before St. Cyr referred to herself as a performer so green that she didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t know her right foot from her left.  But Ms. Stormâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s assets and the threat she posed to the headliner didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t go unnoticed by  St.Cyr.  While Ms. Storm performed onstage, St. Cyr would watch her like a hawk and point out any similarities in their acts to impresario Lillian Hunt.  One night another dancer who performed earlier in the show dropped a pin onstage.  Whereas most dancers used hooks or zippers for their costumes, this dancer used pins.  The barefoot St. Cyr stepped on the pin and when she finished her number she was livid and accused Ms. Storm of leaving the pin behind.   Ms. Storm a fiery redhead with a no nonsense attitude quit on the spot. As she was packing her bags, the quick thinking Lillian Hunt came up with a solution.  She offered to send Ms. Storm to the El Rey Theater in Oakland to perform as the headliner.  From that point on, Tempest Storm never looked back and her star shone brighter and brighter.  She called it one of the luckiest things that ever happened to her.  Fast forward nearly twenty years.  The two women hadnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t crossed paths since that incident at the Follies Theater.  Ms. Storm had just finished headlining the Minskyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Revue at the Aladdin in Las Vegas.  Lili St. Cyr came in to headline the next night.  Stormâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s daughter Trish wanted to meet Lili St. Cyr.  Ms. Storm wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t sure at all what to expect but when they went backstage, St. Cyr welcomed them inside and graciously said, â€œI knew you were going be a star.â€  Stormâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s response, â€œIs that why you bitched about me?â€  That was all it took.  The two legends of burlesque shared a laugh and became fast friends.  After St. Cyr retired from performing, Ms. Storm sent her money from time to time and they remained in contact up to St. Cyrâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s death in 1999.  At the reopening of Cole&#8217;s just down the block from where the original Follies Theater once stood a faded burlesque billboard hangs in the corner near the bar.  The two burlesque divas Tempest Storm and Lili St. Cyr almost look as if they were destined to face off at that moment in time. </p>

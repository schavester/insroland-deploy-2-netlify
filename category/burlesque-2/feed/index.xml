<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"><img loading="lazy" style="float: left; border: 2px solid black;" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2632/4029854013_7d85bc4fab_m.jpg" alt="" width="179" height="240" />Betty Rowland, the Red-headed Ball of Fire (aka the Rhode Island red-head) was a force to be reckoned with during the heyday of burlesque.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She had a stage presence that belied her diminutive stature and she was the highest paid dancer in her field. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Betty was only in her teens when she began dancing professionally at Minskyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s in New York. Burlesque houses thrived in NYC during the early 1930s, but by 1935 citizens groups were trying to close them, and Mayor LaGuardia had deemed burlesque a â€œcorrupting moral influenceâ€.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The cityâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s licensing commission tried pull Minksyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s license, but the State Court of Appeals refused to do so without a criminal conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In 1937 the mayor and the citizenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s groups finally got the break theyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d been waiting for when a stripper at Minskyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s was discovered to be working without her G-string. That was enough for criminal charges to be filed, and Abe Minskyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s license was revoked.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;<img loading="lazy" style="border: 2px solid black; float: left;" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2454/4029854109_1ebf7005d4_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="169" /></span>Minskyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s was the first domino to fall. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>New licensing regulations would allow the burlesque houses to remain in business, as long as they didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t employ strippers!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">The death of burlesque in New York was probably one of the reasons why, in May of 1938, Betty and her troupe opened in Los Angeles at the Follies Theater on Main Street. It was supposed to be a limited engagement, but L.A. audiences loved Betty and she would continue to perform at the Follies for most of her long and successful career.<img loading="lazy" style="border: 2px solid black; float: right;" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2509/4029854329_040b01e367_o.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="192" /> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">In August of this year I was fortunate enough to meet Miss Rowland â€“ she was special guest on <a title="Esotouric" href="https://esotouric.com/" target="_blank">Esotouricâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s</a> â€œHotel Horrors and Main Street Viceâ€ tour. She was absolutely delightful! Vivacious, and still sporting her famously red hair, I found her to be a very classy dame indeed. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">There are so many great stories about Betty that it was tough for me to keep my questions to a minimum. But the one tale that I was most curious about was her arrest in 1952 for giving a lewd performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It struck me as strange that after working in Los Angeles for about 15 years (with only one misdemeanor arrest in 1939) her act was suddenly considered to be lewd. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I knew there had to be more to the story, and there was.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Betty said that one night two LAPD cops arrived at the Follies expecting to get a free pass, but theater manager Maurice Rosen was firm â€“ no freebies. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>In retaliation, cops hauled Betty and Rosen off to the Lincoln Heights jail!<img loading="lazy" style="float: left; border: 2px solid black;" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2778/4030609036_5c1ec574b9_o.jpg" alt="" width="296" height="110" /> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">On November 14, 1952, Maurice and Betty would each be sentenced to four months in the slammer; however, a few weeks later the Los Angeles Times reported that Judge Walters had modified Bettyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s sentence â€“ in part because her attorney had said that Betty was quitting show business to open a perfume store in Beverly Hills with her sister Rose Zelle.<img loading="lazy" style="float: right; border: 2px solid black;" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2652/4029854287_8dd804cd4f.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="500" /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Of his decision to release Betty, Walters said: â€œThe value of incarceration seems to have made its effective marks.â€<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Jail had undoubtedly made an impression on Betty; she said that it was a horrible experience. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The true story of Bettyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s premature release from jail never made it into the newspapers. From what Betty said, it had been strongly â€œsuggestedâ€ to her that if she paid a fine something might be done about reducing her sentence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>According to Betty it was a substantial amount of cash placed in the right hands (and not the Judgeâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s soft heart) that resulted in her release from City Jail. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">If youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d like to see Betty in action, you can view a video clip of one of her performances on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=betty+rowland&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=f" target="_self">YouTube</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You are in for a treat.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lili St. Cyr was a marquee burlesque striptease star known for her bubble bath routine. Tempest Storm who went onstage just before St. Cyr referred to herself as a performer so green that she didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t know her right foot from her left.  But Ms. Stormâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s assets and the threat she posed to the headliner didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t go unnoticed by  St.Cyr.  While Ms. Storm performed onstage, St. Cyr would watch her like a hawk and point out any similarities in their acts to impresario Lillian Hunt.  One night another dancer who performed earlier in the show dropped a pin onstage.  Whereas most dancers used hooks or zippers for their costumes, this dancer used pins.  The barefoot St. Cyr stepped on the pin and when she finished her number she was livid and accused Ms. Storm of leaving the pin behind.   Ms. Storm a fiery redhead with a no nonsense attitude quit on the spot. As she was packing her bags, the quick thinking Lillian Hunt came up with a solution.  She offered to send Ms. Storm to the El Rey Theater in Oakland to perform as the headliner.  From that point on, Tempest Storm never looked back and her star shone brighter and brighter.  She called it one of the luckiest things that ever happened to her.  Fast forward nearly twenty years.  The two women hadnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t crossed paths since that incident at the Follies Theater.  Ms. Storm had just finished headlining the Minskyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Revue at the Aladdin in Las Vegas.  Lili St. Cyr came in to headline the next night.  Stormâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s daughter Trish wanted to meet Lili St. Cyr.  Ms. Storm wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t sure at all what to expect but when they went backstage, St. Cyr welcomed them inside and graciously said, â€œI knew you were going be a star.â€  Stormâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s response, â€œIs that why you bitched about me?â€  That was all it took.  The two legends of burlesque shared a laugh and became fast friends.  After St. Cyr retired from performing, Ms. Storm sent her money from time to time and they remained in contact up to St. Cyrâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s death in 1999.  At the reopening of Cole&#8217;s just down the block from where the original Follies Theater once stood a faded burlesque billboard hangs in the corner near the bar.  The two burlesque divas Tempest Storm and Lili St. Cyr almost look as if they were destined to face off at that moment in time. </p>

<p>The desperate man walked into the Bank of America branch and crossed the lobby to the second teller window&#8211;to Mrs. Joy Holker, 28, the one with the kind eyes. He handed her a brown envelope and a note which read &#8220;This is a holdup. Fill up the envelope. Also have a jar of acid.&#8221; She obeyed, quickly stacking $540 in $10 bills and passing them across the counter. But as she counted, she gave her robber the once-over. She didn&#8217;t buy it, not from this guy. As he turned away, she came out from behind the counter and chased him onto Broadway, screaming &#8220;Stop that man!&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="victim by richardschave, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/5578092128/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5224/5578092128_1e47afc949.jpg" alt="victim" width="149" height="323" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">A motorcycle cop, Charles Randolph, heard her cries, as did patrolman R. Mierdiercks. They took off after the robber, who had darted east on 7<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span> Street. He turned south down Spring, and tried to hide in a parking lot mid-block. They busted him there, and he surrendered peacefully.</p>
<p class="p2"><a title="robber by richardschave, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/5578092062/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5140/5578092062_bb21599e8b.jpg" alt="robber" width="388" height="500" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">Kenneth St. Onge, 35, had a cap pistol, a bottle of colored water and a sob story. He said he&#8217;d come out from Detroit with his wife and seven sons last September, but couldn&#8217;t find any work. For three weeks, the family slept in their 1947 Studebaker, until wife Esther found work as a waitress. They&#8217;d then moved into a quonset hut at 1480 Landa Street, rent $25 a week plus utilities. After two months, the electric bill came. It was $67, which is how they learned their landlord had wired up an apartment, a trailer and a garage to their meter. With only one pair of decent shoes for all the children, he&#8217;d spend his days driving first one, then another child to attend a class or two, then pick up Esther. Whatever she made in tips, that was their dinner fund. Everything else went to the landlord.</p>
<p class="p2">Then Esther got pregnant again, and couldn&#8217;t stay on her feet all day. They had nothing left.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t know what else to do, so he did this.&nbsp; &#8220;I guess I knew I&#8217;d get caught, but I figured at least the State would have to take care of my wife and kids,&#8221; he mused.</p>
<p class="p2">Los Angeles briefly fell in love with the sad sack, especially after he appeared on local television bemoaning his fate. Over $1000 in donations poured in, along with clothes for the kids and a job for daddy at City of Hope. The family was offered a furnished home in La Puente for nothing down.</p>
<p class="p2"><a title="family by richardschave, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/5577504841/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5132/5577504841_f6b35ccb22.jpg" alt="family" width="500" height="414" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">Just over a month after his life of crime fizzled out, a proud Kenneth St. Onge celebrated Easter with his wife and children in court, as Judge Thurmond Clarke ruled &#8220;Because of your record, your family and your children, I am going to grant you probabtion in this case. For robbing a national bank, I&#8217;ve certainly been very lenient.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p2">&#8220;People have been so kind. I know everything is going to turn out all right now. This is,&#8221; said St. Onge, &#8220;the best break I ever had.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p2">And all he had to do to get it was to cross over to the dark side. There&#8217;s a lesson in there somewhere, we guess, maybe nothing more profound than that most folks like to hear about someone who&#8217;s got it even worse than they do.</p>

<P>&nbsp;Andrew McLemore was feeling generous as he entered the Waldorf Bar at 527 S. Main Street. His pockets were stuffed with $896 in cash. That kind of coin can burn a hole in a manâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s pocket, so Andrew ponied up enough bread to buy drinks for himself, and for everyone else in the house!&nbsp;&nbsp;</P><br />
<P>The affable benefactor would likely have continued his largess, if he hadnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t been interrupted by the cops. It seems that he hadnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t actually earned the money â€“ in fact heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d just robbed Lloydâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Bank, one block over at 548 S. Spring St. One of the tellers had trailed Andrew to the bar, and then flagged down a passing police car.&nbsp;</P><br />
<P>Andrew may have been acting on a generous impulse when he bought drinks for Waldorfâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s barflies, but the law was unimpressed. He was handcuffed and hauled off to the slammer.&nbsp;</P><br />
<P>Note to Andrew: No good deed goes unpunished.</P></div>

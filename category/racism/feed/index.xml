<p>Each day at noon, the little children emerge from their classroom at the San Pedro-street school and tramp off to their respective homes to have a nutritious lunch <em>en famille.</em> Dear little creatures, some barely old enough to walk, who spend their days in learning what life is all about, and the skills they&#8217;ll need to navigate this fresh new city they are lucky enough to be citizens of.</p>
<p>On this particular day, the wee ones engaged in their favorite noontime activity, the tormenting of a Chinese vegetable peddler whose route regrettably takes him near to their school. The children fell upon his wagon, snatching up potatoes with which to pelt the&#8230; well, he was not a man, exactly, he was a <em>Celestial</em>, in the parlance of the day.</p>
<p>Enraged, the victim ran at the diminutive mob, waving his blacksnake whip and shrieking invective. What else could you expect from a savage? All the children scattered, save one terrified three-year-old boy. The vendor obligingly whipped the child about the head and the feet, compelling a passing white man to grab the whip and knock the Chinese to the ground. No one was badly hurt, and the parade moved on &#8212; just a typical happening in 1896 LA for all concerned.&nbsp; </p>

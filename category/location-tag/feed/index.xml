										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve discovered another mysterious disappearance tied to the Cecil Hotel. This one somehow eluded all previous archival searches, and it&#8217;s quite an odd and interesting case. I call it The Case of the Missing Consul.</p>
<p><a title="Galbraith feel grave concern over missing headline by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8516677520/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8240/8516677520_b6f9a18a6a_o.png" alt="Galbraith feel grave concern over missing headline" width="145" height="61" /></a></p>
<p>Around noon on December 31, 1947, Alexander M. Galbraith, 50, stepped out of the office where he had served for the past four years as the British Consul for Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and vanished. His daughter Jean, who was his secretary, said he&#8217;d been brooding about the possibility of losing his position to one of the career diplomats who&#8217;d been freed up by the end of the war. He was right to worry. That very morning, he&#8217;d been informed that his services were no longer needed. The reason given was that, though Scottish-born, he was a naturalized American.</p>
<p>Galbraith, who&#8217;d been a WW1 flying ace and had a fiery reputation, was incensed. He was passionate about his position, giving pro-British speeches to local men&#8217;s clubs, dedicating long hours to aiding war brides whose American grooms had abandoned them. And now some bureaucrat was going to take his place? It was too much for him to stand.</p>
<p>On New Years Day, Deputy Coroner Ken O&#8217;Toole said Galbraith had come in, asking about a pair of missing spectacles. But a search of the neighborhood came up empty. A Pullman porter saw a photograph of the missing man, and told police he was certain he&#8217;d served him on a train bound for Chicago. Chicago authorities were alerted, but Galbraith was nowhere to be found. Searches in Washington and Cleveland also turned up nothing.</p>
<p>His wife and daughters were frantic. Weeks passed with no word. The shame of losing his job must have been too much. Had Galbraith killed himself?</p>
<p>He had not.</p>
<p>On January 27, 1948, Galbraith sent a telegram to George B. Stelluto, proprietor of The Green Grill near the Pittsburgh morgue, asking for a loan of $50. Stelluto, a friend, went to the police.</p>
<p><a title="former Greens Grill no Common Plea 310 Ross Street Pittsburgh Google Street View copy by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8516686130/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8087/8516686130_c7bc50c737.jpg" alt="former Greens Grill no Common Plea 310 Ross Street Pittsburgh Google Street View copy" width="500" height="272" /></a></p>
<p>Later, Galbraith told reporters in Los Angeles that he&#8217;d only wired Stelluto because he didn&#8217;t have any money for food. He needed a stake to get back on his feet.</p>
<p>So what had happened to him?</p>
<p><a title="Galbraith pale AP image by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8515562669/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8530/8515562669_7982094821.jpg" alt="Galbraith pale AP image" width="230" height="435" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;I blew my top when I was informed I had been relieved. I packed my bag with several suits and came by train, although I have very little recollection of my departure or arrival. I don&#8217;t remember much until I came to here in this hotel. I vaguely recall being in Canton, Ohio and Chicago, but I&#8217;m not sure how I got here or what I did during that week.&#8221; He said he hadn&#8217;t wanted &#8220;to be a burden&#8221; to his wife of daughters. As for the telegram, he supposed that Stelluto, thinking &#8220;he was serving my interests best&#8221; had gone to the Chief of Police. &#8220;Maybe he was serving my best interests. I hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reached at home, his daughter Jean said &#8220;We&#8217;re all very much relieved that Daddy&#8217;s been located. We certainly don&#8217;t feel that he&#8217;ll be a burden on us and we&#8217;re going to send him the money to fly home. I&#8217;m sure he won&#8217;t have trouble finding another job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galbraith was one of the lucky ones. Many other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insroland.org/ghostsofthececil" target="_blank">troubled souls</a>&nbsp;had found a bed at the Cecil and lacked the courage to ask for help. He went home. Reporters, who always want more, asked after him. Jean said that he was somewhat unwell from his travels, and was resting. Jean protected her father well. We hear nothing more about him, and sometimes hearing nothing is the happiest ending of all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It was with shock and no small amount of horror that we learned that a body, believed to be that of Canadian tourist Elisa Lam, last seen behaving strangely in an elevator security video recorded on February 1, had been discovered today within one of the water tanks on the Cecil Hotel&#8217;s roof. A complaint about low water pressure had prompted an employee to look inside.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="Cecil Hotel roof helicopter screen shot february 19 2013 by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8491046418/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8376/8491046418_037307c15e_o.png" alt="Cecil Hotel roof helicopter screen shot february 19 2013" width="618" height="342" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hotels by their nature are the backdrop for extreme behavior, and any public building that stands for the better part of a century will collect its share of tragedies. The Cecil (established 1927) is notable among true crime aficionados as the short-term residence of serial killers Jack Unterweger and Richard Ramirez, and in all the attention paid to those grim gentlemen, the hotel&#8217;s other heartbreaks too often go unmourned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The probable fate of Miss Lam inspires us to compose a memorial note, to the five prior ladies (and one unfortunate fellow) who left this world on the grounds of the Cecil Hotel, and whose wraiths may yet haunt the place.</p>
<p><a title="hotel-cecil-ad for web by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8491046412/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8366/8491046412_beaa5a459e.jpg" alt="hotel-cecil-ad for web" width="288" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>On June 4, 1964, &#8220;Pigeon Goldie&#8221; Osgood, retired telephone operator and well known protector and feeder of the birds in Pershing Square, was found dead in her room by a hotel worker distributing phone books. She had been stabbed, strangled and raped, and her room ransacked.&nbsp; Near her body were found the Dodgers cap she always wore and a paper sack full of birdseed. Soon after, Jacques B. Ehlinger, 29, was seen walking through Pershing Square in bloodstained clothing. He was arrested, but cleared of the crime, for which no one was ever arrested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day, Goldie&#8217;s friends came together in Pershing Square to express their grief. Jean Rosenstein, a retired nurse, told a reporter &#8220;We were all her friends, all of us here at the square. I was just standing here this morning, thinking about what had happened, when somebody suggested we get some flowers. No one has much money around here, but all of a sudden everyone started giving me what they could. We just wanted her to know we remembered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pigeon Goldie, we remember you, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was October 12, 1962 and Pauline Otton, 27, had been arguing with her estranged husband Dewey in a room on the ninth floor when he decided heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d had enough and went out to get some dinner. She decided sheâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d had enough, too, and jumped from the window. She landed on top of a pedestrian, George Gianinni, 65, and both were killed instantly. Since no one saw Pauline jump, police initially thought they had a double suicide on their hands&#8211;but on closer examination, George had his hands in his pockets and was still wearing shoes, which would have been unlikely if heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d fallen ninety feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pauline, and George, we remember.</p>
<p>On February 11, 1962, Julia Moore climbed out of her eighth floor room window and landed in a second story interior light well. She left no note, just a bus ticket from St. Louis, 59 cents in change, and an Illinois bank book showing a balance of $1800.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Julia, we remember.</p>
<p>On October 22, 1954, Helen Gurnee, 50-something, stepped from her seventh floor window and crashed to her death atop the hotel&#8217;s marquee. She had registered as Margaret Brown a week before.</p>
<p>Helenâ€”or Margaret, as she preferredâ€”we remember.</p>
<p>Elisa Lam, 21, left her home in Vancouver for a solo trip to California. Her plans after visiting Los Angeles were to continue north to Santa Cruz, but it seems that she never left Main Street.</p>
<p>She had the great misfortune to vanish while the Los Angeles Police Department was absorbed with one of the largest manhunts in its history, and one cannot but wonder what impact the search for Christopher Dorner had upon the search for Elisa Lam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps she climbed up the side of the water tank, lifted the hatch, slipped inside, drowned, and then floated there for weeks until her body sank and blocked the pipes. Maybe someone who knew the nooks and crannies of this very old establishment put her there. In time, the answer will come, but it will make no great difference. She is gone, and she remains.</p>
<p>Elisa, we remember. And hope the souls that went before can lend some comfort now to yours.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Should you step into the lobby of the King Edward Hotel at the corner of 5<sup>th</sup> and Los Angeles Streets in L.A.&#8217;s historic Skid Row, and pause to admire the black and gold Egyptian marble fixtures, ionic columns and sweeping mezzanine stair, the odds are better than good that the fellow behind the counter will draw your attention to the clock above the desk and the fancy raised initials just below it.</p>
<p><a title="King Edward Hotel IMG_4833 for blog by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8229267892/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8208/8229267892_caf72d5850_z.jpg" alt="King Edward Hotel IMG_4833 for blog" width="428" height="640"/></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in answer to your predictable question, he&#8217;ll reply: &#8220;Teddy Roosevelt! He stayed here when he visited Los Angeles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="King Edward Hotel IMG_4833 TR crop by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8229267338/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8069/8229267338_e5e03ce678_z.jpg" alt="King Edward Hotel IMG_4833 TR crop" width="579" height="332"/></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Presidential sleepover would be a point of pride for any establishment&#8211;all the more so in a young city in the far west. How marvelous a fact, and no wonder the King Eddy&#8217;s staff is so quick to share it. (We&#8217;ve confirmed that this information has been passed down through oral tradition since at least the mid-1970s.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="King Edward Hotel fiesta pinback 1903 by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8228198577/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8340/8228198577_5c3ac0c27f_m.jpg" alt="King Edward Hotel fiesta pinback 1903" width="220" height="221"/></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one problem. Theodore Roosevelt&#8217;s famous visit to Los Angeles was on May 8, 1903. He attended the Fiesta de las Flores parade, and stayed that night at the fashionable&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insroland.org/annasvoices" target="_blank">Westminster Hotel</a>&nbsp;at 4<sup>th</sup> and Main Streets, two blocks away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="King Edward Hotel May 9 1903 LAT page 45 Roosevelt at Fiesta screen grab by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8229265802/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8478/8229265802_f3ee304cbf_z.jpg" alt="King Edward Hotel May 9 1903 LAT page 45 Roosevelt at Fiesta screen grab" width="470" height="544"/></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The King Edward didn&#8217;t open until 1906.</p>
<p>Oh, but then Roosevelt must have stayed at the King Edward on a later tour of the Southland, right?</p>
<p>Well, historical records do show that Roosevelt return once more to Los Angeles, for two days in March 1911, when the ex-President spoke at Occidental College and Throop Polytechnic.</p>
<p>His stay at Pasadena&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/cms/story/detail/a_world_unto_itself/11309/" target="_blank">Hotel Maryland</a> was well publicized, and included a <a href="http://www.pe.com/local-news/riverside-county/riverside/riverside-headlines-index/20111217-riverside-ex-president-roosevelt-meets-former-slave.ece" target="_blank">poignant meeting</a> with an aged slave who had been owned by Roosevelt&#8217;s maternal family in Antebellum Georgia.</p>
<p>But there appears to be no documentation of a stop at the King Edward or any other Los Angeles hotel.</p>
<p>So why in the name of all that&#8217;s historical are the initials T.R. stuck up above the desk of the King Edward Hotel today?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been wracking our brains, and have come up with a few theories worth floating.</p>
<p>Perhaps before the Westminster Hotel&nbsp;fell to the wrecking ball in 1960, someone went to the auction and bid on a piece of commemorative marble, transporting the legend of a Presidential visit along with the physical artifact back to the nearby establishment?</p>
<p><a title="King Edward Hotel Westminster roosevelt slept here wrecking by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8229265516/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8488/8229265516_1c7d0b68a8_z.jpg" alt="King Edward Hotel Westminster roosevelt slept here wrecking" width="547" height="388"/></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A tempting notion, but a rare 1920s-era promotional map printed by the King Edward includes a photo of the lobby, which while printed using the halftone technique which makes it impossible to &#8220;zoom in&#8221; and see finer details, certainly appears to already show a set of initials there beneath the clock.</p>
<p><a title="King Edward Lobby circa 1920 from our map watermark by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8229265942/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8229265942_7d8a180f47_z.jpg" alt="King Edward Lobby circa 1920 from our map watermark" width="640" height="297"/></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;<a title="King Edward Hotel clock detail circa 1920 by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8229303910/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8489/8229303910_b62cc2f18a.jpg" alt="King Edward Hotel clock detail circa 1920" width="396" height="349"/></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, could they represent an owner of the hotel? The King Edward was built by architect John Parkinson and operated in its early years by Colonel E. Dunham, Tommy Law and Thomas L. Dodge. Not a &#8220;T.R.&#8221; in the bunch.</p>
<p>Having weighed and sorted these and other, less reasonable, possibilities, we&#8217;re prepared to come down on the side of one unsupportable, but eminently pragmatic solution: that the patriotic initials are merely a tip of the hat to a popular politician, and an answer to any testy patron who might question the red-blooded Americanism of a hotel named for a foreign king.</p>
<p>We reckon that&#8217;s as good a theory as any, and we&#8217;re sticking with it until and unless something better comes along.</p>
<p>Which leaves the initials &#8220;T.R.&#8221; above the desk of the King Edward, and the abiding oral tradition of the great man&#8217;s visit, something of a mystery&#8211;but no less beguiling for that. Since everyone who knew the real answer is dead, we&#8217;re free to craft our own myths to pass along to Angelenos who&#8217;ll come after. Why do <em>you</em> believe the initials &#8220;T.R.&#8221; are there under the clock in the King Eddy?</p>

<p>The Boston was the department store founded by the Robinson family; the building, missing its upper stories, today houses a wedding chapel.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Prosperity Carnival and Indoor Fair opened at 6pm on Saturday, December 11 to an audience of 5000 eager souls, and for the next 30 days, there was no place more amusing &#8212; or peculiar &#8212; in all the southland.</p>
<p><a title="opening festivities LA Times by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8182615348/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8200/8182615348_676d83e4e1_o.png" alt="opening festivities LA Times" width="682" height="608" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Above: Huge crowd celebrates the opening of the festivities. Photo: LA Times</em></p>
<p>The fair began with the &#8220;wedding&#8221; of Mr. Midget (real name: Lajos Matina, one of the Hungarian Matina triplets, all later <em>Wizard of Oz</em>&nbsp;Munchkins) to Miss Midget (Elise Broek). The couple were residents of Midget City, whose troupe appeared under the leadership of Prince Ludwig, whose professional bio had him a wee member of European royalty. Miss Midget, by the by, was a suffragette.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Above: Prince Ludwig addresses his subjects at Midget Village, an attraction at the 1933 World&#8217;s Fair. Photo: Chicago Tribune</em></p>
<p>Prize rabbits and pigeons by the hundreds were exhibited, with Los Angeles husbandry clubs competing against those fuddyduds in Pasadena.</p>
<p><a title="blanche payson colliers 1915 by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8182577627/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8486/8182577627_698fcd6b9c_o.gif" alt="blanche payson colliers 1915" width="111" height="350" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Above: Officer Payson at the PPIE, where she protected lady fairgoers from mashers. Photo: Collier&#8217;s.</em></p>
<p>Like large ladies in uniform? (Who doesn&#8217;t?) Then you won&#8217;t want to miss an audience with Mrs. Blanche Payson, popular 6&#8217;4&#8243; PPIE policewoman, who was on display in her cute &#8220;coppette&#8221; garb. You can still enjoy Mrs. Payson in some classic short <a href="http://www.lordheath.com/index.php?p=1_278_Blanche-Payson">comedies.</a></p>
<p>Hold your nose on the third floor, where a grand cat show, organized by the Los Angeles Cat Fanciers Association, featured prize-winning kitties from overseas and around the country.</p>
<p><a title="Turkish Harem by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8182577331/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8182577331_e3a5907c1c_o.jpg" alt="Turkish Harem" width="550" height="739" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Above: Some of the pretties on display. Photo: LA Times.</em></p>
<p>The fifth floor was transformed into an Oriental Village staffed with young lovelies, each of them a &#8220;real Egyptian princess&#8221; and a talented dancer. They also had a pet serpent named Zoo, and Turkish cigarettes and water pipes available for male visitors to sample. This show was developed for the 1893 Chicago World&#8217;s Fair and had been touring ever since.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Old Hawaii,&#8221; a song and dance show, was considered one of the higher-class attractions of the fair.</p>
<p><a title="siamese twins by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8182615538/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8337/8182615538_c5bb00ddf2.jpg" alt="siamese twins" width="267" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Then there was a Human Fish, who appeared to eat, drink and sleep inside his tank. And a chance to coo at the three-year-old Cuban-born Siamese <a href="http://phreeque.tripod.com/hinojosa_twins.html">twins</a>&nbsp;Josephina and Guadalupe Hinojosa.</p>
<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more! All the way from Van Nuys come&#8230; (wait for it)&#8230; 500 high-class chickens. Under the direction of W.P. Whitsett of the Chamber of Commerce, locals brought their best birds to show off the suitability of the SFV as a center of chicken ranching. The first such ranch opened just three years ago, and by 1915 there are 150 of them. The aim was to &#8220;make Van Nuys the Petaluma of Southern California.&#8221; Favorite entrants included Lord Roselawn I, a majestic White Leghorn rooster and Sport, a Barred Plymouth Rock. Also on view: fighting cocks who battled in cages.</p>
<p>And for the kiddies, Santa distributed gifts beneath one of the largest Christmas trees ever brought to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>One of the weirdest elements of the fair was the Baby Bollinger Show, a wax replica of the malformed Chicago infant whose <a href="http://www.waragainsttheweak.com/offSiteArchive/HitlerDebtToAmerica.html" target="_blank">death</a> the previous month had been national news. Allan Bollinger had the misfortune to be under the &#8220;care&#8221; of Dr. Harry Haiselden, a proponent of euthanasia and eugenics who not only convinced the boy&#8217;s parents to let their &#8220;sure-to-become-a-criminal&#8221; infant die rather than attempt any lifesaving surgeries, but actively sought media attention for doing so. The controversy over the Bollinger case led an ethics complaint against Haiselden, who would later star in an autobiographical pro-eugenics film called <em><a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/disability/ba_shows.dir/children.dir/highlights/bsmovsti.html" target="_blank">The Black Stork.</a></em></p>
<p><a title="101 Ranch WENONA (1913) Half-Sheet by richardschave, on Flickr" href="/web/20160307123451/http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8182577111/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8057/8182577111_902ec4c644_c.jpg" alt="101 Ranch WENONA (1913) Half-Sheet" width="518" height="800" /></a></p>
<p>And then there was Princess Wenona with her Miniature Wild West Show.  Princess Wenona, previously called Lillian Smith, perched atop her piebald pony Rabbit, was a star marksman in the 101 Ranch wild west show and had appeared with Buffalo Bill Cody in the 1880s.   Her theatrical back story claimed that her mother was kidnapped by Sioux Indians, and that Lillian was the result of a liaison with Crazy Snake, a chief.</p>
<p>She was of Indian ancestry, just not from the Plains. In fact, she was born in Coleville, near the California-Nevada border. At 7 she got her first rifle, and became the terror of the Yosemite bird population. In her teens she joined the Buffalo Bill show and played to crowds of up to 200,000 in Staten Island, NY.</p>
<p><a title="Jim_&amp;_Lillian by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8182575517/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8069/8182575517_5cbc11757f_o.jpg" alt="Jim_&amp;_Lillian" width="618" height="474" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Above: Lillian Smith on the road, with performer friends and her rifle collection.</em></p>
<p>She was billed as &#8220;The California Huntress,&#8221; &#8220;Champion Girl Rifle Shot&#8221; and &#8220;The California Girl,&#8221; and a prize of $10,000 was offered to anyone who could out shoot Princess Wenona. They say nobody ever claimed that prize.</p>
<p>She had a great rivalry with the established performer Annie Oakley, who began lying about her age as Wenona&#8217;s star ascended. In 1887, both women performed in England on the same bill. At a special performance for the Queen, it is said that Victoria rose for the first time in her life to salute the American flag. While in London, Oakley quarreled with Bill Cody and left the show, leaving Wenona the sole star lady sharpshooter, until Oakley and Cody made up.</p>
<p><a title="geronimo with princess wenona by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/8182614540/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8070/8182614540_34ec8a308b_c.jpg" alt="geronimo with princess wenona" width="800" height="641" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Above: Princess Wenona with Buffalo Bill Cody and the famous Apache leader Geronimo, 1901</em></p>
<p>In later years she became rather plump, drank too much and had several unhappy marriages, so by the time she played the Prosperity Carnival, we can assume she was not the star she&#8217;d been. Still, such tricks as shooting out a candle flame or the ashes off a man&#8217;s cigar remained crowd pleasers.</p>
<p>She retired around 1925 and lived out her days on a ranch in Oklahoma with many former Wild West Show friends and dozens of stray dogs that she cared for. She died during the bitter cold winter of 1930, aged 59.</p>
<p>And these are just a few of the more than 150 shows and 200 concessions on display at the Los Angeles Prosperity Carnival and Indoor Fair. Don&#8217;t you wish you could have seen them all?</p>

<p>A girl of 16, Sadie Engelmann, left her family to try her hand at fame and fortune on the stage.Â  In San Diego, her beauty, if not her craft, won her many admirers, among them a dashing stenographer with the US Navy by the name of John Harvey.</p>
<p>When Sadie found herself abandoned by John and in need of a midwife, she checked in to the Bellevue Avenue Lying-in Institute in Los Angeles, where she deposited a newborn boy, whom she left in the care of the proprietress, &#8220;Dr.&#8221; Catherine Smith. At this point a disagreement ensued between Sadie and &#8220;Dr.&#8221; Smith concerning the details of the babe&#8217;s status.Â  Sadie claimed she left the child temporarily in &#8220;Dr.&#8221; Smith&#8217;s care, in order to earn enough money to pay the bill she incurred during her delivery. She testified that once she had settled her debt she would re-assume custody of the child.Â  &#8220;Dr.&#8221; Smith alleged Sadie sold her the newborn outright to pay off her debts and to free herself from the undue burden of its care.Â  Whatever the exact nature of their understanding, &#8220;Dr.&#8221; Smith appears to have taken possession of the child, and in turn sold the baby boy to a Mrs. W.W. Wilson, who had already acquired three other infants in a nefarious plot to appear as if she were the mother of quadruplets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4689025025_a4db3baf50.jpg" alt="Stole baby quartet" width="500" height="129" /></p>
<p>The miraculously sudden appearance of the quartet of babies attracted the attention of the authorities, who promptly summoned Mrs. Wilson, &#8220;Dr.&#8221; Smith, Sadie Engelmann, and other parents of the illegitimate infants in to court to sort out the affair.Â  During the course of the trial, Sadie Engelmann claimed to have been accosted and threatened by various burglars &#8220;of Mexican aspect,&#8221; who, she alleged, were sent by &#8220;Dr.&#8221; Smith to dissuade her from testifying. <img loading="lazy" style="float: right;" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4046/4689669600_4568bf8c08.jpg" alt="" width="191" height="375" /></p>
<p>According to court testimony, Mrs. Wilson grew despondent after many years of trying to bear her own children, and eventually conceived the plan to to fill her and her husband&#8217;s home with a readymade brood of abandoned youngsters. She enacted this plan years before the quadruplets affair, procuring three children, whom she presented to her husband as his own, each time using an ingenious series of pads and pillows to trick him into believing she had indeed carried each child to term. The children were in the couple&#8217;s possession at the time of Mrs. Wilson&#8217;s attempted quadruplets heist.</p>
<p>The trial ended with the conviction of &#8220;Dr.&#8221; Smith on the charge of child stealing. Upon appeal, the court handed down a sentence of 5 years probation, during which Smith was to cease and desist the practice of midwifery.</p>
<p>Eventually, Mrs. Wilson was permitted to adopt the three children in her care before the trial, and to become a foster-mother to the two girls among the quadruplets. The boys, including Sadie Engelmann&#8217;s son, did not survive infancy. Mrs. Wilson went on to take on more foster-children, and to run a daycare facility in Hollywood.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="body">
<div>
<p>The old Menlo Hotel, corner of Winston and Main, was the way station for many a visiting Angeleno, and the last exit for a few. The Menlo offered moderate weekly and monthly rates to appeal to the varied respectable folk who flocked to the growing city. Most of them are long forgotten, but it&#8217;s hard to feel badly about this obscurity. When the names are known, too often there&#8217;s tragedy attached.</p>
<p>Case in point, Mrs. Harriet Mortimer Palmer, aged 25. On the afternoon of April 10, 1890, she used a revolver to shoot herself through the heart in her room in the Menlo. Harriet and her husband, both invalids, had come from Toronto during the winter. They lived quietly in the hotel, he struggling with his heart disease and she with consumption.</p>
<p>In March, her condition worsened, but when Dr. T.J. McCarthy was called, she refused his care, and demanded to move into an adjoining room away from her spouse. Once alone, Mr. Palmer spoke candidly with the doctor, complaining that his wife&#8217;s nervousness and irritability were a torment, as were her regular threats to do harm to herself. The worry was impacting his own health.</p>
<p>On April 10, Mr. Palmer had a crisis, and the doctor came several times to attend to him. It was during one of these visits that a shot rang out in the next room, and when McCarthy rushed in, he found Mrs. Palmer dying, sprawled across the pillows she had heaped upon the bed to catch her as she fell. The bullet passed through her left breast, spine and shoulder, and was recovered about fifty feet down the hall. A note in her satchel read &#8220;I am thoroughly tired of life and so end it by my own hand. Please kindly send notice of my death to my aunt in Canada.&#8221; As for Mr. Palmer, he was reported to be in critical condition, and it was feared the shock of his wife&#8217;s death would kill him. But if it did, his passing did not make the papers. The maids came in and cleaned their rooms, and life at the Menlo went on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5046/5246748263_d6cf8872d3_m.jpg" alt="menlo hotel palmer suicide headline" width="217" height="160" /></p>
<p>Late one evening in March 1896, a respectable looking young woman in a gown of black, woolen brocade and a matching cape lined with salmon silk made her way out to Westlake Park. She removed her cape and hat, placed them neatly on a bench, and drowned herself in the lake. In the morning, her things were spotted by gentlemen walking in the park, and after a brief search, her corpse was found floating near the shore.</p>
<p><a title="Westlake Park Boat House, usc collection CHS-32466 by richardschave, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richardschave/5247338240/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5289/5247338240_38fc6d865e.jpg" alt="Westlake Park Boat House, usc collection CHS-32466" width="500" height="382" /></a> <em>Â </em></p>
<p><strong><em>above: Westlake Park Boat House circa 1900, California Historical Society Collection, USC</em></strong></p>
<p>Unidentified, her body was exhibited for most of the day in the undertaking parlor of Orr &amp; Hines, where a stream of grim voyeurs trailed through, each pretending they hoped to give a name to the victim. In the afternoon, a friend finally gazed upon the face and knew it: William Davis, restaurant man, declared &#8220;This girl was until recently my mother&#8217;s chambermaid at the Menlo Hotel. She left a week ago last Sunday, giving us no reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her purse was found a pawn ticket from Mr. Morris&#8217; shop, showing that she&#8217;d left a watch under the name Nellie Emerson. This was the name the Davises first knew her by, although over the five months of her employment they had accidentally found that she was really called Minnie Judy. Minnie was 24 with family in the Northwest, and had been out on her own since the age of 16. She was described as unfailingly good natured, so her departure and apparent suicide were a mystery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5286/5247349122_18b5b795b9_m.jpg" alt="menlo hotel judy suicide headline" width="226" height="135" /></p>
<p>Two men came forward with stories of having seen the girl before her fatal plunge. Veterinarian R.T. Whittlesay, offices on Broadway near Seventh (just a block from the funeral home where she lay on display), remembered a sad face gazing into his window on Tuesday night and was certain it was she. And an unnamed colored man who worked in a Winston Street corral and had known her for a year claimed he saw Minnie Judy the night of her death coming out of the old Los Angeles Theater with a dashingly dressed, dark-haired man. He said he heard the man suggest they catch a cab, as the last streetcar had passed. But officials had doubts about this tale, as the witness described the girl as wearing a large, feathered hat, not the small, modest one found on the bench in the park.</p>
<p>Why would a girl drown herself in 1890s Los Angeles? We have the usual suspicions. Had she been &#8220;ruined&#8221; by some cad, or did she have an inner sadness she didn&#8217;t show to other people? Was she really out at the theater with an unknown man the night she died? We&#8217;ll likely never know. But spare a moment to remember this poor lost girl of the city, and Messers Walters, Irving, Holt and Canserd whose morning constitutional was shattered by their discovery of the waterlogged lass, and the hundreds who took a few moments of their day to gaze upon a dead, drowned face for their amusement. And remember too the old Menlo Hotel, which was briefly home to thousands of anonymous souls, and to a very few whose names we know.</p>

<p>When Lillie Hattery came from San Bernardino to visit her sister in Los Angeles in late January, she arrived with the names of people rumored to perform â€œcriminal operations.â€Â  â€œDr.â€ Hastings, who practiced without the benefit of a medical license, was third on the list.Â  According to testimony at the trial, Lillie paid $200 for Hastings&#8217; services, which included multiple applications of electrical current to the back and abdomen, as well as a surgical procedure, which resulted in copious blood loss by the patient.Â  Lillie suffered from fever, convulsions, and severe pain for a week, during which Hastings treated her solely with electrical stimulation. Two licensed medical doctors examined Lillieâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s body after it had been delivered to the morgue, and determined that the cause of death was septicemia due to blood poisoning.Â  They also determined that she had been pregnant and undergone an attempted abortion.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2425/3899732806_5a10e95d27.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></p>
<p>At his trial, Hastings testified that Lillie Hattery suffered from an injured ankle, which he treated with electrical stimulation.Â  He claimed that she appeared in good health until the very last moment before she succumbed to what he assumed must have been an internal abnormality such as a diseased heart or some other affliction.Â  Although the prosecution presented evidence of perjury and intimidation of witnesses on the part of both Hastings and his nurse, along with surgical instruments found in Hastingsâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> offices that were commonly used for abortion procedures, as well as closed court testimony from a young woman who had recently undergone the criminal operation in Hastingsâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> care and had almost died, the jury still found Hastings innocent in the death of Lillie Hattery.</p>
<p>Hastings was even able to post bond during the trial, thanks to the generosity of a female admirer, and re-located his Medical Electrician clinic for business down the street in the Hammond Block at 120 1/2 South Spring.Â  Hastingsâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Medical Electrician Clinicâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Grand Opening so provoked a dentist in residence there that the man came to blows with the rental agent, and promptly moved out of the disgraced office building, where, he claimed, no decent woman would now darken a door.</p>

<p>After his acquittal, Hastings married the woman who posted his bond.Â  In later years she turns up as one of the many sufferers who find miraculous relief at the hands of the great healer, Rama, of the Rama Institute at 305 Â½ South Spring Streets, Los Angeles. One can only wonder why Mrs. Hastingsâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> own husband was unable to heal her deafness with his electrical stimulation.</p>

<p>Dr. Calvin S. Hastings was still practicing medicine without a license in 1911 when the state attorney filed a complaint against him during a campaign to shut down so-called â€œQuack Chink Doctors.&#8221;</p>

<p><img style="width: 208px; height: 486px;" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2475/3933134878_f4a4c7bd5b.jpg" align="left" border="0" vspace="" hspace="">This battle of titans began in the fall of 1894, when the miraculous magnetic healer known as the Boy Phenomenon (aka Dr. Stuart Franklin Temple) came to the city â€œwith Healing in his Hands,â€ offering his free curative powers to the deaf, blind, sick lame, paralytic and whomever else who managed to drag themselves to the Los Angeles Theater. Before the healing commenced, Templeâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s manager, the Great Diagnostician Professor W. Fletcher Hall, lectured on the medical research supporting the application of Vital Force and Animal Magnetism.&nbsp; The duo took the show on the road to Pasadena, San Bernardino and San Diego, but then parted ways in 1895.&nbsp; The following year, Professor Hall reappeared in Los Angeles with a new protÃ©gÃ©, a young German boy he discovered among the â€œrubbersâ€ in the Turkish baths at St. Louis, who must have impressed Hall with his restorative manual dexterity.&nbsp; His given name was Carl Herrmann, but Hall dubbed him The Boy Wizard, and distinguished him in advertisements from Dr. Temple by claiming he â€œdaily generates ten times more magnetism that the former Phenomenon.â€ </p>
<p>The Boy Wizard began his run in January of 1896 at the Music Hall, and also offered private consultations at $1.00 a pop at the Pacific Coast Magnetic Institute, his and Hallâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s establishment on Third and Broadway. Unlike the Phenomenon, the Boy Wizard allegedly possessed a deft touch with the ladies.&nbsp; According to his manager the Boy Wizard had an&nbsp; â€œunbroken record in treating complaints peculiar to the gentler sex and his Magnetic Force has proved a boon to the suffering woman.â€&nbsp; </p>
<p>If only I had a dime â€¦<img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2608/3932356343_674cda4dd5.jpg" align="right" border="0" vspace="" hspace=""></p>
<p>It didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t take long for the erstwhile Phenomenon, Dr. Temple, to discover that the Wizardâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s ads featured the same testimonials as his so recently had, and Temple promptly brought suit against the magnetic newcomer.&nbsp; The lawsuit occasioned some lovely copy in the LA Times, including this lede:&nbsp; â€œDissension reigns in the realms of occultism, and there is the grind of clashing auras and the shock of opposing batteries.â€ </p>
<p>All parties appear to have settled out of court, as the papers contain no mention of a trial date or ruling, and The Boy Wizardâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s trail goes cold a few weeks after the lawsuit was threatened.&nbsp; </p>
<div style="text-align: left;">By October of 1899, Dr. Temple, the Phenomenon, resurfaces as the<br />
manager of Kohler the Oriental Seer, and in new digs, at the California<br />
College of Occult Sciences at 245 South Spring.&nbsp; But the partnership<br />
turns out to be a short-lived affair. Before three months have passed<br />
the institution and Dr. Temple have vanished. </div>

<P>&nbsp;Andrew McLemore was feeling generous as he entered the Waldorf Bar at 527 S. Main Street. His pockets were stuffed with $896 in cash.

<div style="text-align: justify;">When Mrs. Austin&#8217;s 13-year-old sister came to her complaining of cramps, big sis knew just what the doctor ordered: a healthy slug of Jamaica Ginger should make the pain, if not vanish, seem deliciously insignificant. The youngster was dosed, waited for relief, then complained anew. That&#8217;s when Mrs. Austin realized her mistake: the medicine she&#8217;d proffered was not Jamaica Ginger, but Arnica!</div>
<p>Convinced she had poisoned her sister and that the girl would surely die, Mrs. Austin telephoned for a doctor. Somehow the police were notified of a suicide at the address, and came to investigate. They found the crampy sister none the worse for wear for her dosingâ€”which was a lucky break, since Arnica is rarely taken internally, and can cause illness or death&#8211;and Mrs. Austin most abashed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2560/3907346042_0efcb9d149_o.png" border="0" alt="" align="middle" /></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-style: italic; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: LucidaGrande;">(L.A. Times, May 28, 1896)</span></span></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: LucidaGrande;"></p>
<p>Jamaica Ginger has a long and fascinating history, in SRO Land and throughout America. A favorite remedy for pretty much anything that ailed you, this rocket-powered ginger jolt was packed to bursting with health-giving alcohol&#8211;around 150 proof.&nbsp; All was well until the 18th Amendment was passed, and anti-drink regulators began requiring the addition of adulterants that made Jamaica Ginger, commonly and most affectionately called &#8220;jake,&#8221; taste horrible.</p>
<p>Many formulas were introduced in an attempt to produce a palatable, legal Jamaica Ginger recipe, among them Harry Gross&#8217; and Max Reisman&#8217;s 1930 version, packed with delicious tri-ortho cresyl phosphate (TOCP), a plasticizer. Shortly after the new formula debuted, tens of thousands of jake drinkers began presenting at hospitals complaining of mysteriously drooping toes and other symptoms of paralysis. Upstanding citizens who had hitherto kept their benders on the down low were exposed by the easily recognized Jake-Leg Shuffle, a limp shared by many habituÃ©s of the concoction.</p>
<p>The poisonous formulation was soon discovered and taken off the shelves, but the damage had been done. While some jake abusers recovered, others suffered long term nerve damage.</p>
<p>For more on jake leg&#8217;s cruelties, and the syndrome&#8217;s role in the history of the Delta blues, see Dan Baum&#8217;s 2003 <span style="font-style: italic;">New Yorker</span> <a href="http://danbaum.com/Nine_Lives/Articles_files/Jake%20Leg,%20New%20Yorker.pdf">feature</a> (PDF download).</p>
<p>As for us, we&#8217;re sticking with Vernors!</p>

<p>Today my new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/L-Noir-Struggle-Americas-Seductive/dp/0307352072">L.A. Noir: The Struggle for the Soul of America&#8217;s Most Seductive City</a> is finally out. As such, it seems like a fitting time to introduce InSROland readers to one of my two subjects, future LAPD chief William H. Parker. (The other, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is mobster Mickey Cohen.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1922, Bill Parker â€” who would rule the LAPD with an iron hand from 1950 to his death in 1966 (and, some would say, beyond the grave) â€” moved to Los Angeles. He didn&#8217;t live inSROland, but he did work there â€” as an usher at the California Theater, an imposing Beaux Arts theater at the corner of Main and Eighth Street. A year later, he switched jobs, moving two blocks north to Loews State, a glorious, 2,600-seat theater, reportedly Los Angelesâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s most profitable movie palace, in the heart of the Broadway movie district. There the man who would later emerge as one of conservative Catholicism&#8217;s most striden spokespersons encountered something new â€” the femme fatale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first was Theodosia Goodman, a tailorâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s daughter from Ohio, who, in the hands of her press agents, became Theda Bara, â€œforeign, voluptuous, and fatalâ€ â€” a woman â€œpossessed of such combustible Circe charms,â€ panted Time magazine, â€œthat her contract forbade her to ride public conveyances or go out without a veil.â€ Others soon followed â€” Pola Negri, Nita Naldi, Louise Brooks. Women werenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t the only ones steaming up the screen. In 1921, Rudolph Valentino rode off with the hearts of women around the world as The Sheik, the mesmerizing Arab who kidnapped, wooed, lost, saved, and ultimately won an English lady-socialite as his bride (Agnes Ayres).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the movies heated up, so did the imaginations of the public. No one was more vulnerable than the people most exposed â€” theater employees. â€œLove is like the measles,â€ explained one girl usher to the Los Angeles Times. â€œYou canâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t be around it all the time without catching the fever.â€</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bill Parker caught the fever.</p>

As a young man, however, he was ensnared. Soon after arriving in Los Angeles while he was working as an usher, Parker met Francette Pomeroy, a beautiful, high-spirited young woman, aged nineteen â€” almost two years older than himself. The exact circumstances of their first meeting are unknown.  However, itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s easy to understand how Francette (who went by â€œFrancisâ€) might have fallen for Bill. He was an unusually handsome young man â€” slender, of medium height, with a high forehead, prominent nose, and large, intelligent eyes. He was smart and attentive; even then, he had a sense of presence. On August 13, 1923, the two eloped and were married in a civil ceremony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite (or perhaps because of) the failure of his own parentsâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> marriage, young Bill Parker had very conventional ideas about his relationship with Francis. Francis did not share these ideas. On the contrary, she saw no reason why marriage should interfere with the life she previously enjoyed, which involved music, dancing, and active socializing, including a continuing association with other young men. This came as a shock to Bill. In time, Parkerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s family would come to view Francis as sex addict&#8230;</p>

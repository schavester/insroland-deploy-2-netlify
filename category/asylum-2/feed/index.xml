<p>Allegations of cruel and inhuman abuse of the inmates at Highland surfaced in the summer of 1903, after San Bernardino papers published a series of investigations into graft and financial irregularities at the institution.&nbsp; The nurses charged that female patients were routinely operated on without the benefit of anesthesia, and were punished by â€œprotective sheetingâ€ or immobilization in their beds under sheets of heavy canvas, sometimes for weeks at a time.&nbsp; The nurses also testified to the common punishment known as â€œgiving the hypoâ€, hypodermic injections of apomorphia, a violent emetic that causes hours of agonizing cramps, followed by hours of vomiting and eventual collapse. The injections were repeated usually twice a day, for five days at a time, for such mild infractions as insubordination and â€œtalking in excess.â€</p>

He also testified that the drug hyosine was used to punish recalcitrant patients, a medication which works on the kidneys and puts the victim to sleep.&nbsp; He alleged that at least one patient died as a result of a punitive hyosine injection. &nbsp;</p>

Anticipating his own dismissal, a lower level official committed suicide on the grounds of the asylum.&nbsp; One year after leaving Highland, Dr. Dolan also departed this life.&nbsp; Whether he succumbed to heart disease or died by his own hand remains a mystery to this day.</p>

<p><img style="width: 208px; height: 486px;" alt="" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2475/3933134878_f4a4c7bd5b.jpg" align="left" border="0" vspace="" hspace="">This battle of titans began in the fall of 1894, when the miraculous magnetic healer known as the Boy Phenomenon (aka Dr. Stuart Franklin Temple) came to the city â€œwith Healing in his Hands,â€ offering his free curative powers to the deaf, blind, sick lame, paralytic and whomever else who managed to drag themselves to the Los Angeles Theater. Before the healing commenced, Templeâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s manager, the Great Diagnostician Professor W. Fletcher Hall, lectured on the medical research supporting the application of Vital Force and Animal Magnetism.&nbsp; The duo took the show on the road to Pasadena, San Bernardino and San Diego, but then parted ways in 1895.&nbsp; The following year, Professor Hall reappeared in Los Angeles with a new protÃ©gÃ©, a young German boy he discovered among the â€œrubbersâ€ in the Turkish baths at St. Louis, who must have impressed Hall with his restorative manual dexterity.&nbsp; His given name was Carl Herrmann, but Hall dubbed him The Boy Wizard, and distinguished him in advertisements from Dr. Temple by claiming he â€œdaily generates ten times more magnetism that the former Phenomenon.â€ </p>
<p>The Boy Wizard began his run in January of 1896 at the Music Hall, and also offered private consultations at $1.00 a pop at the Pacific Coast Magnetic Institute, his and Hallâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s establishment on Third and Broadway. Unlike the Phenomenon, the Boy Wizard allegedly possessed a deft touch with the ladies.&nbsp; According to his manager the Boy Wizard had an&nbsp; â€œunbroken record in treating complaints peculiar to the gentler sex and his Magnetic Force has proved a boon to the suffering woman.â€&nbsp; </p>
<p>If only I had a dime â€¦<img alt="" src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2608/3932356343_674cda4dd5.jpg" align="right" border="0" vspace="" hspace=""></p>
<p>It didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t take long for the erstwhile Phenomenon, Dr. Temple, to discover that the Wizardâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s ads featured the same testimonials as his so recently had, and Temple promptly brought suit against the magnetic newcomer.&nbsp; The lawsuit occasioned some lovely copy in the LA Times, including this lede:&nbsp; â€œDissension reigns in the realms of occultism, and there is the grind of clashing auras and the shock of opposing batteries.â€ </p>
<p>All parties appear to have settled out of court, as the papers contain no mention of a trial date or ruling, and The Boy Wizardâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s trail goes cold a few weeks after the lawsuit was threatened.&nbsp; </p>
<div style="text-align: left;">By October of 1899, Dr. Temple, the Phenomenon, resurfaces as the<br />
manager of Kohler the Oriental Seer, and in new digs, at the California<br />
College of Occult Sciences at 245 South Spring.&nbsp; But the partnership<br />
turns out to be a short-lived affair. Before three months have passed<br />
the institution and Dr. Temple have vanished. </div>
